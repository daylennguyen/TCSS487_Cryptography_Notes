## Advance Encryption Standard (AES)

> - New federal standard as of 2001
>
> - Based on the Rijndael algorithm
>
> - 128-bit blocks, keys can be 128, 192 or 256 bit
>
> - unlike DES, does not use Feistel structure
>
>    - The entire block is processed during each round
>
>  -  Design uses some very clever math
>
>      - See section 8.5 of the text for a concise summary
